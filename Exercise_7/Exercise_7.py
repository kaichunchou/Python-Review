Exercise 7

Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
'''

def main():
    a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
    print('{} has following even elements: '.format(a))
    print([x for x in a if x%2 == 0])

    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
